Astro Academia is an Astro template for a personal academic website. It brings your research, publications, CV, and writing into one place, with content stored in Markdown and TypeScript files alongside the site.

The template includes a blog with tags and pagination, search across posts and publications, light and dark themes, an RSS feed, and a sitemap. The build produces a static website you can host on GitHub Pages or another static hosting service.

## Getting started

Fork this repository, then clone your fork. From the project directory, install dependencies and start the development server:

```sh
nvm install
nvm use
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The `.nvmrc` file specifies the project's Node.js version. If you use another version manager, select that version before installing dependencies.

Open the local address printed in your terminal, usually `http://localhost:4321`. Changes to your content and settings appear as you edit.

## Make it yours

### Profile and settings

Start with [src/settings.ts](src/settings.ts). It exports four objects:

| Export | What to change |
| --- | --- |
| `profile` | Your name, title, institute, research areas, and the author name highlighted in publications. |
| `social` | Your email and links to social or academic profiles. Set unused values to `''` to hide their icons. |
| `template` | Your deployed URL, base path, navigation position, themes, transitions, excerpt length, and posts per page. |
| `seo` | The default page title, description, and social preview image. |

For example, replace the `profile` export with your details:

```ts
export const profile: Profile = {
  fullName: 'Alex Smith',
  title: 'Research Fellow',
  institute: 'University of Example',
  author_name: 'Alex Smith',
  research_areas: [
    {
      title: 'Scientific Computing',
      description: 'Numerical methods for modelling physical systems.',
      field: 'computer-science',
    },
  ],
}
```

Research area icons are defined in [src/data/researchIcons.ts](src/data/researchIcons.ts). Choose a matching field or add your own.

Some content lives directly in Astro components. Replace the introduction in [src/components/Welcome.astro](src/components/Welcome.astro), the short research description in [src/components/ui/Hero.astro](src/components/ui/Hero.astro), and the sample text and page title in [src/pages/research.astro](src/pages/research.astro).

Replace `src/assets/profile_pictures.jpg` with your photo and `public/favicon.svg` with your favicon. Add a social preview image under `public/` and set `seo.default_image` to its public path, for example `/images/social-preview.png` for `public/images/social-preview.png`.

### CV and publications

Edit [src/data/cv.ts](src/data/cv.ts). It exports separate `experiences`, `education`, `skills`, and `publications` arrays. The CV page reads all four; the papers page uses the same publications array.

Keep those export names and replace the placeholder entries. For example:

```ts
export const education = [
  {
    school: 'University of Example',
    time: '2018 - 2022',
    degree: 'Ph.D. in Computer Science',
    location: 'Amsterdam, Netherlands',
    description: 'Research on numerical methods for physical simulations.',
  },
]

export const experiences = [
  {
    company: 'Example Research Lab',
    time: '2022 - Present',
    title: 'Research Fellow',
    location: 'Amsterdam, Netherlands',
    description: 'Developing tools for scientific computing.',
  },
]
```

Use `time` for dates and `school` for education institutions. The CV sorts entries using the end of the `time` range; use a format such as `2018 - 2022` or `2022 - Present`. Set unused arrays to `[]` to hide those CV sections.

The fields for skills and publications are defined in [src/types/cv.ts](src/types/cv.ts). Publications include a title, authors, journal, and time, with optional link and abstract fields.

### Blog posts

Add Markdown files to `src/content/BlogPosts/`. Each post needs a title, a quoted date, and an excerpt. Tags are optional.

For example, create `src/content/BlogPosts/field-notes.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "Notes from the field"
date: "2026-09-23"
excerpt: "Observations from our latest round of measurements."
tags: ["research", "fieldwork"]
---

Our latest measurements raised a few questions about the model.

Write the rest of your post here using Markdown.
```

Posts are included in the blog automatically. Replace or remove the sample post before publishing.

### Themes

Set `template.lightTheme` and `template.darkTheme` in `src/settings.ts` to theme names enabled in [src/styles/global.css](src/styles/global.css). That stylesheet contains the DaisyUI theme configuration and is also the place to add your own styles.

## Build and deploy

Before building, set `template.website_url` and `template.base` in `src/settings.ts` for your hosting location:

| Hosting location | `website_url` | `base` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Pages project site | `https://your-username.github.io` | `/your-repository` |
| GitHub Pages user site | `https://your-username.github.io` | `''` |
| Custom domain | `https://example.com` | `''` |

These values are used by the Astro configuration and site links. Replace the default localhost URL before publishing.

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The build writes the site to `dist/`. Preview it locally, then configure your static hosting service to run `npm ci` and `npm run build` with the Node.js version from `.nvmrc`, and publish `dist/`.

For GitHub Pages, configure a Pages deployment workflow to build and upload `dist/`. The workflows currently included in this repository run development checks and update the changelog; deployment needs its own setup.

## Development checks

```sh
npm test       # Core search tests
npm run lint   # ESLint
npm run check  # Astro diagnostics and TypeScript checks
```

GitHub Actions runs these checks on pushes and pull requests. The tests cover search indexing, filtering, content and URL preparation, snippets, and loading recovery.
